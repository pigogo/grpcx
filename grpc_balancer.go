	// ii) If it returns an address on which the connection is under construction

	//  * fails RPC if the RPC is fail-fast and connection is in the TransientFailure or
	//  Shutdown state;

	// If opts.BlockingWait is true, it should return a connected address or
	// block if there is no connected address. It should respect the timeout or
	// cancellation of ctx when blocking. If opts.BlockingWait is false (for fail-fast
	// RPCs), it should return an address it has notified via Notify(...) immediately
	// instead of blocking.
	//
	// The function returns put which is called once the rpc has completed or failed.
	// put can collect and report RPC stats to a remote load balancer.
	//
	// This function should only return the errors Balancer cannot recover by itself.
	// gRPC internals will fail the RPC if an error is returned.

	// load balancer. gRPC internals will compare it with the existing connected
	// addresses. If the address Balancer notified is not in the existing connected
	// addresses, gRPC starts to connect the address. If an address in the existing
	// connected addresses is not in the notification list, the corresponding connection
	// is shutdown gracefully. Otherwise, there are no operations to take. Note that
	// the string slice must be the full list of the Addresses which should be connected.
	// It is NOT delta.
